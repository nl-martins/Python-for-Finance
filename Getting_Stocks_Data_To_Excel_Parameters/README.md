# Getting Stocks Data To Excel Introducing Parameters
This script is an evolution of the 'Getting Stocks Data To Excel' and allows you to change the range of dates, ticker, and name of the Excel file without touching the code.

You also can save it into an csv file using the function .to_csv() of the pandas package instead of .to_excel(). Also remember to change the format of the file (.xlsx, .csv)

If you know a better way to implement the input validations just let me know. Learning is always the focus!
