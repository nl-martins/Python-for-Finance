# Getting Stocks Data To Excel
This script allows you to get historical prices of a STOCK between a range of dates and save it into an excel. 

You also can save it into an csv file using the function .to_csv() of the pandas package instead of .to_excel(). Also remember to change the format of the file (.xlsx, .csv)
